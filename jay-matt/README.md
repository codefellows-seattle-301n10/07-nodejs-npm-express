# Project Name

**Author**: Jay & Matt
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code Fellows 301 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
We built an application that receives articles served from a locally run node server. We are now able to add new articles through a series of input fields which upon submission are then placed into the JSON with the existing articles.   

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
They need a locally installed version of node and express. They can then access the site with thier browser via port 3000.

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
We have a node server and express back-end and utilize HTML5, CSS3, and ES6 JavaScript for our front-end. We are also useing jQuery for simplified DOM manipulation and AJAX for communication with the server.

## Change Log
<!-- Use this are to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an examples:

## Credits and Collaborations
