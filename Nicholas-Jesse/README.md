# Lab 07

**Author**: Nicholas Welch, Jesse Atay
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
The problem domain for this application is allowing users to interact with a site, using remote data. We built the middleware for the server-side application that manages the asynchronous requests.
## Getting Started
The user does not need to do anything, other than go to a valid URL for the site. Anything else will result in a 404 error.

## Architecture
The site uses HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, Node.js, and Express.js and nodemon.

## Change Log
3/31/2018 - Site up and running
4/2/2018 - Last changes for turnin.
